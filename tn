            The greatest mathematician of the eigthteenth century, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Leonhard Euler</span>was born id Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant of mathematics, Jean Bemoulli. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics and mathematics at St.<span style="font-weight: bold;">Petersburg Academy</span>of Sciences. Euler was the most prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over 800 different books and paper. His influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well. Euler's work on mathematical analysis,<span style="font-style: italic;">Introductio in analysin infinitorum</span>(1784) remained a standard textbook for well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote <span style="font-style: italic ;">Lettres a une princesse d'Allemagne</span> (1768-1722), diving a clear non-technical outline of the main physical theories of the time.

            One can hardly do math without copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such as e and pi, were introduced in Euler's writings. He is perhaps best known for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler's fomula

            demonstrates the relationship between algebra, commplex analysis, and trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derive the equation

            which relates the fundamental constans:0,1,,e, and i in a single beautiful and elegant statement.

            Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.
